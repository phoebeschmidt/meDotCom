<!-- <p>I like to work with people and write code, and I'm working on becoming an excellent developer. I'm interested in being outside, intentional communities, intersectional feminism, and cheese. I have great attention to detail, and I'm a clear and direct communicator. I always ask lots of questions.</p> -->
